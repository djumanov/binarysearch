### 1. Sum of First N Odd Integers
Given an integer n, return the sum of the first n positive odd integers.

**Constraints**\
`n ≤ 1,000`

**Example 1**

Input\
`n = 5`

Output\
`25`

**Explanation**
The first `5` odd integers are `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` and its sum is `25`.

### 2. Sum of Two Numbers Less Than Target
Given a list of integers nums and an integer target, return the sum of the largest pair of numbers in nums whose sum is less than target. You can assume that there is a solution.

**Constraints**\
`2 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` where `n` is the length of nums

**Example 1**

Input/
`nums = [5, 1, 2, 3]`\
`target = 4`

Output\
`3`

Explanation\
Sum of the largest pair of numbers less than `4`is `1 + 2 = 3.`
